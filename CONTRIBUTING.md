# Contributing to Outp0st

Our vision for Outp0st is for it to become the trusted standard toolbox (read: UX layer) for the open source contracts infrastructure landscape. Think of it like Kubernetes for developer experience or CMS-like interface for blockchain entrepreneurs. We realize this is an ambitious goal. We can‚Äôt do it alone.

Therefore we want to create a strong community of contributors -- all working together to create the kind of delightful experience that our developers deserve.

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Outp0st is released under the Apache 2.0 License, and original creations contributed to this repo are accepted under the same license.

A lot of this vision, open source techniques and texts are inspired by amazing work of [backstage.io](https://backstage.io) team, please leave a star on thier repo.

## Types of Contributions

### Report bugs

No one likes bugs. Report bugs as an issue [here](https://github.com/genolis/outp0st/issues/new?template=bug_template.md).

### Fix bugs or build new features

Look through the GitHub issues for [bugs](https://github.com/genolis/outp0st/labels/bugs), [good first issues](https://github.com/genolis/outp0st/labels/good%20first%20issue) or [help wanted](https://github.com/genolis/outp0st/labels/help%20wanted).


### Adding Non-code Contributions

Since there is such a large landscape of possible development, build, and deployment environments, we welcome community contributions in these areas in the [`/contrib`](https://github.com/genolis/Outp0st/tree/main/contrib) folder of the project. This is an excellent place to put things that help out the community at large, but which may not fit within the scope of the core product to support natively. 

### Write Documentation

The current documentation is very limited. Help us make the `apps/web/docs` folder come alive.


### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file [an issue](https://github.com/genolis/outp0st/issues).

If you are proposing a feature:

- Explain in detail how it would work.
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
- Use appropriate labels
- Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :)
