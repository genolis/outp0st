## Concept

- UI is based on Terra station repo
- It operates using state, check state json [examples](/docs/examples)
- State is stored in localstorage of your browser
- State contains no security related information
- You can download/upload state
- You can upload and share state using IPFS storage providers (web3.storage for now)
